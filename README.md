# 👋 Hey, I’m Sam Bakri

I’m a software engineer who enjoys building systems from the ground up — from interpreters and compilers to servers, databases, and developer tools.  
Through both practice and study, I’ve developed a strong foundation in **systems programming, concurrency, networking, and software design**.

## 🛠️ What I Bring to the Table

- **Systems Programming Expertise**  
  Comfortable working close to the metal, with experience in C, C++, Go, Rust, and Python.  
  I’ve implemented core components of shells, databases, containers, and distributed clients — which taught me how OS primitives, processes, and memory management work under the hood.  

- **Concurrency & Parallelism**  
  Deep understanding of multithreaded programming, synchronization, and lock-free design.  
  Skilled in building safe, efficient concurrent applications in C++ and Go.  

- **Networking & Protocols**  
  Hands-on experience implementing network servers and clients from scratch.  
  Familiar with low-level packet parsing, DNS resolution, TCP/IP internals, and asynchronous I/O.  

- **Software Design & Architecture**  
  Strong grasp of modern C++ software design principles, modularity, and reusable architecture.  
  Comfortable applying patterns and abstractions while balancing performance and maintainability.  

- **Compilers, Interpreters & Parsing**  
  Built interpreters, regex engines, and compilers from the ground up.  
  This sharpened my skills in tokenization, parsing, evaluation, and efficient execution models.  

- **Distributed Systems & Reliability**  
  Experience designing and prototyping systems that handle concurrency, caching, and data consistency.  
  Knowledge of messaging systems, containerization, and scaling services.

## 🌱 Current Focus

- Mastering **concurrent and distributed system design**.  
- Applying **low-level systems knowledge** to high-performance backend engineering.  
- Building projects that bridge **theory and production-ready software**.
